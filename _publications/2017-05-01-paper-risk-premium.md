#Introduction

In emerging markets, the investor may encounter instability of the political regime, external conflict, corruption, civil strife and war, control of exchange rates, unexpected inflation, various defaults, the expropriation of private capital and other events in the country. Therefore, to succeed in emerging markets must take into account the whole situation together. To this end, we introduced the concept “country risk”.
Country risk - is a complex process, the nature of which can be varied and is determined by the dynamics of the interaction of many financial, socio-economic and political factors. Country risk - a risk that the actions of the sovereign will affect the ability of the debtor related with this country to fulfill its obligations
The nature of the risk can be different and is determined by factors on which it is based - political, economic, financial, social and others.
Effective risk management, demonstrating the potential benefits, at the same time requires solving a number of conceptual and practical problems. First, it depends on the ability to quantify the risks. In turn, as a measure of risk requires the identification of the uncertainty and its potential effect.
All of these causes the actuality of the work.
The statement of the work is to study the country risk premium in emerging markets.
Problem objectives of the work:
- To explore the concept of "country risk"
- To consider the models and methods for estimating the country risk
- To learn the rules for estimating the country risk premium
- To estimate the country risk premium on the example of Kazakhstan
In our work, we used the following methods:
- The method of theoretical analysis: review of the theoretical aspects of the assessment of country risk and calculate the country risk premium.
- The method of comparative analysis: comparison of different methods for calculating the premiums for country risk.
