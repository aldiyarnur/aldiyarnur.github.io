Thank you for visiting my page. 

<img src="/images/avatar_icon.png" width="300px"  style="float: left; padding-right: 30px;"/> My name is Aldiyar. I live and work in Toronto, ON. I'm an aspiring data scientist at my job where I work on things like customer analytics and building models of customer behaviour, as well as experimental design. I do a whole lot of my work with Python, but I also like doing things with R. I also do a little bit of teaching on the side. I'll write about all kinds of different things here.
