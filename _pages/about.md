Thank you for visiting my page. 

<img src="/images/avatar_icon.png" width="300px"  style="float: left; padding-right: 30px;"/> My name is Aldiyar. I am currently stationed in Toronto, ON. I grew up in Almaty, Kazakhstan; moved to London, the UK during my teens; finished my undergrad in Vancouver, BC. I crossed the border again to Russia for the World Cup; spent many months in other countries backpacking; moved to Toronto in 2019.

I'm a professional economist and an aspiring data scientist. I worked on things like customer analytics and building models of customer behaviour, equity research and DCF models for mining companies as well as PE predictive models and macroeconomic analysis and simulation of neoclassical growth models. I do a whole lot of my work with Python and Excell, but I also like doing things with Python. I did a little bit of tutoting on the side. I'll write about all kinds of different things here.
