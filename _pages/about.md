Thank you for visiting my page. 

<img src="/images/avatar_icon.png" width="300px"  style="float: left; padding-right: 30px;"/> My name is Aldiyar. I am currently stationed in Toronto, ON. I grew up in Almaty, Kazakhstan; moved to London, the UK during my teens; finished my undergrad in Vancouver, BC. I crossed the border again to Russia for the World Cup; spent many months in other countries backpacking; moved to Toronto in 2019.

I'm a professional economist and an aspiring data scientist. I worked on things like customer analytics and building models of customer behaviour, equity research and DCF models for mining companies as well as PE predictive models and macroeconomic analysis and simulation of neoclassical growth model. I do a whole lot of my work with Python and Excell, but I also like doing things with Python. I did a little bit of tutoring on the side. 

As a kid, I was playing chess on a professional level, achieving the title of Candidate National Master and a spot on a junior national team. Currently, I participate in the local open tournaments.


Recently, I have completed the Bachelor of Internationa Economics with a minor in Mathematics. The program was focused at strengthening theoretical knowledge of economics and business. In addition to the core subjects, I also took a modules in abstract mathematics. Prior to this, I have completed A-level program at Cambridge Turos College with AAAAa.

My first experience of academic research was a replication study of the paper by Kane and Rouse (1995) "Labor-Market Returns to Two- and Four-Year College", which was part of the research internship at VSE. The project involved a literature review, replication of main findings, analysis of the results and of the discrepancies between the original and replicated results, econometric tests of the estimates and discussion of the ideal research design. 

My keen interest in economic research was the main reason for taking up the analyst position at the Research Department at Halyk Finance, the leading investment bank in Kazakhstan. My major duty was to write regular reports about recent trends and short- to medium-term economic prospects. I was also responsible for communicating the economic view to officials, foreign research teams, traders and media. 


The main reason for my interest in economics and data science, in particular, is my belief that a quantitative understanding of data is the major tool for predictive ability and understanding of the causes of the things.

<img src="/images/vol.jpg" width="300px"  style="float: left; padding-right: 30px;"/>My passion for travelling, football, chess and sharing knowledge emanates from my curiosity and love for learning. My travelling experiences brought me to Quelonios del Caribe, Costa Rica, where I aided agricultural community and saved some sea turtles while learning about environmental conservation, social change, and community development. I also volunteered at the World Cup 2018, where I was a part of the hospitality and protocol team. 

As a member of the national chess team, I travelled around the CIS and Eastern Europe to participate in numerous tournaments. Competing with great teams from Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, I learned that I am not a good chess player.
